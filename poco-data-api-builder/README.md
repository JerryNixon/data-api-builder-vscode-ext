## Features

- Adds a right-click context menu for files named `dab-config.json`.
- Automatically generates C# code that developers can integrate into their projects.

## Customizations

There's no T4 template or anything like that. Because of this, there are no customizations supported. Maybe someday, but not today. This gets most of you 100% of the way and the rest closer to 90%.
