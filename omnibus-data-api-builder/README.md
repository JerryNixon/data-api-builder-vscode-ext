> An omnibus is a collection of works, stories, or items compiled into a single volume, often linked by theme or author. The term originates from the Latin *omnibus*, meaning "for all," derived from *omni-* ("all") and a plural dative ending indicating inclusivity. But in the case of the *-bus* suffix in *omnibus*, it specifically means "for all" or "to all." Interestingly, the word "bus" as we use it today is a shortened form of *omnibus*, originally applied to public transportation vehicles to signify they were "for all" passengers. Related words include *omnipotent* ("all-powerful"), *omniscient* ("all-knowing"), and *omnivore* ("eats all kinds of food").
